Uber Media
===========
A networked media application allowing multiple terminals, or media-computers, to be deployed and controlled using a web-interface featuring CSS3 and HTML5;
a wide-range of media items are supported through a dynamic plugin-system, with the items indexed in a virtual file-system to allow fast searching and virtual
organization and data-collection (such as user-ratings and descriptions pulled from third-party services).

Features:
> Virtual file-system; multiple folders, which can be local or file-shares, can be indexed.
> Open-ended plugin-system which allows for custom-written interfaces to be used to play items.
> Easy-to-use and easy to deploy due to not requiring any software to be installed on the client-side.
> AJAX to reduce bandwidth and increase functionality.
> Thumbnail generation of media items.
> Ability to pull movie descriptions using the RottenTomatoes API, with a custom algorithm for intelligent seaches if the title is malformed.
> Multiple media-computers can be installed, requiring only unique identifiers; this increases networked efficiency whilst providing centralized control and distribution. This feature
may also be suitable for commercial applications.
> Terminals can automatically connect to a central node.
> Ability to play/view:
-- Images
-- Video
-- Audio
-- YouTube

To-do/current issues:
> BBC iPlayer interface abandoned; consider redoing and reverse engineering again.
> Implement backward-compatible web features if the user lacks HTML5.
> Menu on the server-side for TV-remote/media-remote users.
> User system with modifiable permissions.
> Implement error overridable event in all interfaces.
> Implement API for developers.
> Implement automatic media conversion of files (with the ability to keep/delete the original file).
